# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for a clean and efficient Linux/Unix desktop environment, specifically tailored for:

* **Hyprland:** My Wayland compositor setup.
* **Kitty:** My preferred terminal emulator.
* **Mako:** My Wayland notification daemon.
* **Waybar:** My highly customizable Wayland bar.
* **Wofi:** My application launcher/menu for Wayland.

## What's Included

This repo specifically tracks the configuration files located in the following directories within my `~/.config/` folder:

* `hypr/`
* `kitty/`
* `mako/`
* `waybar/`
* `wofi/`

All other application configurations, caches, and temporary files are explicitly ignored to keep this repository lightweight and focused.
